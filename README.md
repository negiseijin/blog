## Deploy your own
You can copy this repository and deploy it to Netlify by clicking the button below.

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/negiseijin/blog"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>

After clicking that button, youâ€™ll authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name. Netlify will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the template. Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard when the build is complete.

## Build & Deployment

### Deploying with CLI

You need to install Netlify's CLI first:

```
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

Then run the following command:

```
make deploy
```

### Deploying with Netlify Build

Create a new Netlify site and link it to your repository. Netlify will detect the Rust toolchain automatically, build the code and deploy it for you.
